# Lab 1-1: Hello World
#### Introduction to Java Course
---
## Lab Objectives

1. To get you up and running in the VM environment you will be using for this course.

2. To run a simple Hello World App in three different ways

## Part One: The Application

The following is the standard "Hello World" application required by law to be the first exercise done in any introdctory programming class.

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String []args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
```

If you are new to Java it may seem a bit awkward compared to say Python

```python
    print('Hello World')
```

Bit remember the discussion about how code is packaged up in an OO language: every method or function has to be defined within a class definition. The class HelloWord is just a container for us to put the one line of executable code.

Python, on the other hand, allows us to declare and use code without having to put it in any sort of container 

The rest of the Java code will become more clear as we go through the course.

## Part Two: Using Eclipse

If you already know how to use Eclipse then you can skip over the setu
